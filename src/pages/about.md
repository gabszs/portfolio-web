Hello! I'm Gabriel Carvalho, 
a back-end developer with experience in building and automating complex processes. I specialize in Python and C#, but my enthusiasm for DevOps has driven me to create my own homelab to host applications.

Here I talk about topics such as:
- Homelabbing
- Advanced Python features and tips, such as asyncio and async programming
- DevOps automation (Iâ€™m also a huge fan of GitOps and CI/CD pipelines)
- Web APIs (REST, for example)
- Containers and Kubernetes
- Professional tips
- Communication and life hacks

I currently work as an software engineer at Huawei, where I've developed internal tools and automations for processes like payment systems and employee management, saving over $50K through efficient solutions. 

I'm dedicated to continuous improvement, effective communication (with a focus on NLP), and aligning with company values. I'm always looking to expand my skills and contribute to innovative projects.

## Tech Stack

Here are the main technologies used in my development stack:

- Python (FastAPI, Pandas, Selenium)
- C#
- Cloud services (Huawei Cloud, AWS)
- Containerization with Docker and Kubernetes
- PostgreSQL & Redis for data management
- Automation with RabbitMQ and CI/CD using GitHub Actions
- Virtualization using Proxmox
- Unix/Linux environments
